# Make a program that can encrypt texts with and alphabetical caesar cipher.  This cipher can ignore numbers, symbols, and whitespace.
# For extra credit write a "decrypt" function to your program.


#Get input from user


#Separate into individual characters in an array


#Convert each character in to ASCII value (65..90 for upcase, 97..122 for downcase)


#Evaluate any in upcase range


#For each value, add or subtract based on input by user (in range 1..25)

#If value is over 122, subtract 122 and add 96 to put it back in range
